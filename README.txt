This is a typing tester program. It measures your word per minute (WPM) and stores it in a file according to username. The data structure used is File. I was inspired to make it by using the website typeracer.com for our first assignment and felt like trying this and it worked out alright. Thank you Abhijeet sir for giving me an opportunity to do so.

The code was written in windows and with conio.h so it may not run on ubuntu unless libconio or gconio library functions are installed.

Code and demo video are uploaded on GitHub.
